PAMSA or "Prototype Autonomous MineStat Agent" is a Discord bot written in Ruby that is capable of querying Minecraft servers using [MineStat](https://github.com/FragLand/minestat). The project name is an homage to PAMA (Prototype Autonomous Management Agent) from [Minecraft: Story Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft:_Story_Mode).
